    "# Hands-on exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to get your hands on some Audio models and apply what you have learned so far. \n",
    "This exercise is one of the four hands-on exercises required to qualify for a course completion certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the instructions.\n",
    "In this unit, we demonstrated how to fine-tune a Hubert model on `marsyas/gtzan` dataset for music classification. Our example achieved 83% accuracy. \n",
    "Your task is to improve upon this accuracy metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to choose any model on the [ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) that you think is suitable for audio classification, \n",
    "and use the exact same dataset [`marsyas/gtzan`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/marsyas/gtzan) to build your own classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to achieve 87% accuracy on this dataset with your classifier. You can choose the exact same model, and play with the training hyperparameters, \n",
    "or pick an entirely different model - it's up to you!   \n",
    "\n",
    "For your result to count towards your certificate, don't forget to push your model to Hub as was shown in this unit with \n",
    "the following `**kwargs` at the end of the training:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "kwargs = {\n",
    "    \"dataset_tags\": \"marsyas/gtzan\",\n",
    "    \"dataset\": \"GTZAN\",\n",
    "    \"model_name\": f\"{model_name}-finetuned-gtzan\",\n",
