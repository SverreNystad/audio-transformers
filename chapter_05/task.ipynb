    "In this unit, we explored the challenges of fine-tuning ASR models, acknowledging the time and resources required to\n",
    "fine-tune a model like Whisper (even a small checkpoint) on a new language. To provide a hands-on experience, we have\n",
    "designed an exercise that allows you to navigate the process of fine-tuning an ASR model while using a smaller dataset.\n",
    "The main goal of this exercise is to familiarize you with the process rather than expecting production-level results.\n",
    "We have intentionally set a low metric to ensure that even with limited resources, you should be able to achieve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the instructions:\n",
    "* Fine-tune the `”openai/whisper-tiny”` model using the American English (\"en-US\") subset of the `”PolyAI/minds14”` dataset.\n",
    "* Use the first **450 examples for training**, and the rest for evaluation. Ensure you set `num_proc=1` when pre-processing the dataset using the `.map` method (this will ensure your model is submitted correctly for assessment).\n",
    "* To evaluate the model, use the `wer` and `wer_ortho` metrics as described in this Unit. However, *do not* convert the metric into percentages by multiplying by 100 (E.g. if WER is 42%, we’ll expect to see the value of 0.42 in this exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have fine-tuned a model, make sure to upload it to the 🤗 Hub with the following `kwargs`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "kwargs = {\n",
    "     \"dataset_tags\": \"PolyAI/minds14\",\n",
    "    \"finetuned_from\": \"openai/whisper-tiny\",\n",
    "    \"tasks\": \"automatic-speech-recognition\",\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You will pass this assignment if your model’s normalised WER (`wer`) is lower than **0.37**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to build a demo of your model, and share it on Discord! If you have questions, post them in the #audio-study-group channel."
